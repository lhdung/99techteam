# Troubleshooting High Memory Usage on an NGINX Load Balancer VM

## **Initial Investigation**
1. **Verify Monitoring Data**:
   - Use commands like `free -h`, `top`, or `htop` to confirm memory usage.
2. **Check NGINX Logs**:
   - Review `/var/log/nginx/access.log` and `/var/log/nginx/error.log` for unusual activity.
3. **Inspect System Logs**:
   - Check `/var/log/syslog` or `journalctl` for memory-related warnings or errors.
4. **Identify Processes**:
   - Use `ps aux` or `top` to identify processes consuming the most memory.
   ```
        top -o %MEM 
        ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -10
    ```
5. **Check Nginx memory usage**
    ```
        pmap -x $(pgrep -x nginx) | sort -k3 -nr | head -10
    ```

## **Possible Root Causes and Scenarios**

### **A. High Traffic Load**
- **Scenario**: Sudden traffic surge causes NGINX to use more memory.
- **Impact**: Increased response times, timeouts, or service degradation.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Scale up VM resources (e.g., increase memory).
  - Optimize NGINX configuration (e.g., adjust `worker_processes`, `worker_connections`, buffer sizes).
  - Implement rate limiting or caching.
     ```
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=mycache:10m inactive=60m;
    ```
  - Introduce rate limiting
    ```
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;
    ```


### **B. Memory Leak in NGINX**
- **Scenario**: NGINX gradually consumes more memory without releasing it.
- **Impact**: Performance degradation, out-of-memory (OOM) errors, service crashes.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Restart NGINX to free up memory.
  - Update NGINX to the latest stable version.
  - Review and optimize NGINX configuration.

### **C. Misconfigured NGINX**
- **Scenario**: Improper settings (e.g., excessive buffer sizes, too many worker processes).
- **Impact**: Inefficient resource utilization, reduced performance.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Adjust NGINX configuration:
    - `worker_processes`: Set to the number of CPU cores.
    - `worker_connections`: Adjust based on expected traffic.
    - Buffer sizes: Reduce if unnecessarily large.
    ```
     grep -E 'proxy_buffer|fastcgi_buffer' /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ```
    - Disable or optimize logging:
    ```
    access_log off;
    error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
    ```
    - Rotate logs frequently
    ```
    logrotate /etc/logrotate.d/nginx
    ```

### **D. Upstream Service Issues**
- **Scenario**: Slow or unresponsive upstream services cause NGINX to hold connections longer.
- **Impact**: Increased memory usage, slower response times, timeouts.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Investigate upstream services for performance issues.
  - Adjust NGINX timeouts (`proxy_read_timeout`, `proxy_connect_timeout`).
  - Implement health checks for upstream servers.

### **E. System-Level Issues**
- **Scenario**: Memory fragmentation or kernel issues on the VM.
- **Impact**: System instability, potential crashes.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Reboot the VM to clear memory fragmentation.
  - Check for kernel updates or patches.
  - Consider migrating to a different VM or host.

### **F. External Attacks**
- **Scenario**: DDoS attack or brute-force attempts cause excessive memory usage.
- **Impact**: Service unavailability, degraded performance.
- **Recovery Steps**:
  - Implement DDoS protection (e.g., rate limiting, firewall rules, CDN).
  - Block malicious IPs using NGINX or a firewall.
  - Analyze traffic patterns to mitigate the attack.

## **Long-Term Mitigation**
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up proactive monitoring for memory usage, traffic spikes, and NGINX errors -> Set up Prometheus + Grafana alerts.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Implement auto-scaling for the VM or NGINX instances.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review NGINX configuration and upstream services.
- **Load Testing**: Conduct load testing to identify bottlenecks.

## **Summary of Actions**
1. Confirm memory usage and identify the primary memory consumer.
2. Check NGINX and system logs for errors or unusual activity.
3. Investigate traffic patterns and upstream service performance.
4. Optimize NGINX configuration and restart the service if necessary.
5. Scale resources or implement protective measures (e.g., rate limiting, DDoS protection).
6. Monitor the system post-recovery to ensure stability.
